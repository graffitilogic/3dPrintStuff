# Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny 
Fan-Made 3d Printable Prop

## Backstory, Setting of Expectations

In early spring of 2023, [I built a small Indy / Jock Lindsey's Hangar Bar themed bar](http://arcadeshenanigans.com/blog/2023/2/27/indybarbuild) in our basement storage area turned unfinished game room.  As of mid-April 2023 I started to ask around on the internet looking for a Dial of Destiny / Archimedes Antikythera Mechanism to put with some other Indy props behind the bar.   At the time there wasn't much available.

So, based on a few screenshots and a lot of tinkering, I started trying to fill the gap with something open-source and fan-made that fellow Indy fans could use in their own builds.  Since the early work is based on guesstimates and screenshots, it isn't going to pass the muster for screen-accuracy and the mechanisms aren't functional.

*For the lawyers..* This isn't meant to be a replacement for whatever prop eventually gets released for the Parks but a stop-gap, made-for-fun, non-for-profit fan-made 3d Printing project.   As soon as I can guy the real prop, assuming one comes out - I absolutely will. 

I'm an R&D engineer (mostly software but some hardware repair and design) but pretty novice in 3d-modeling.   I did, however capture screen recordings of the majority of the creation process in Shapr3D.

a) its a novelty to watch  
b) it cuts off any "hey, that's my design" shenanigans claims that might emerge from keyboard warriors later

## Design Notes
Based on the trailers and screenshots, I presume the prop to be a MacGuffin that gets assembled in stages throughout the film leading to some final-Act use of the device that either a) melts someone's face or b) saves the day in the Hero's hands.    The screenshots show seams that lead me to believe the outer-box assembly probably assembles horizontally once the parts in the center assembly have been assembled and aligned in the correct order.  The initial build separated the design into a Box, a Floor and then a stack of components that get added.
I'm artistically challenged, so the glyph work and artistic aspects are going to be up to you in your final build.

**Print and Assembly Instructions**

I printed the Box and the floor separately on a textured plate.  Oriented horizontally, the box will require supports for the center shelf and if you print the box-option with detailed sides, the sides will require supports.   Removing the supports from those box-side details is sort of a pain in the buttocks.    Although, I ended up with some pretty convincing looking toolmarks from removing all the little plastic support boogers from those side details.   You could also choose to print the box vertically oriented with a brim and it will use less support material.

I'm pretty sure that the movie model is going to have those parts inset into the side of the box but if you've already printed the model and would like to add the side details, I exported the squares and chiclet-gear-whatever-they-are models so you could print and glue them onto the plain-sided version of the model.  (Out-y vs Innie)  If you go that route, you'll probably want to experiment with the z-Scale so they aren't quite so tall.

I printed the floor with a high infill for stability, the box with a 50% infill for weight.  I used [Iridium Gold](https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/pla-metal?variant=41002951737480) but wasn't happy with the unpainted color, so use whatever works best for your preference.

Print the Glyph Disc.  I did this on [natural](https://a.co/d/8vbXQfL) and eventually on a [Marbled](https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/pla-marble?variant=41003162992776) filament which looked pretty cool. My early prints had top-layer issues, so I eventually printed this solid.  YMMV.  The Glyph Disc will probably require some artwork on your part to match the movie.  

..while your white, natural or marble material is loaded go ahead and print these as well:
Outer Inset Ring
Inner Inset Ring
Compass Face
Large Post Spacer
Small Post Spacer
Large Disc Spacer
Small Disc Spacer. 

The Inset Rings and Compass face will also get decorated so print with smooth surface in mind, add top layers or print them solid.  Decorate the Outer and Inner Insets, the Compass Face and Glyph Disc before assembly.

Print the Spirals in a metallic filament or paint it in a [metallic hammered](https://a.co/d/cb4FKrY) rattle-can. 
Next, in [Gold Filament](https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/pla-metal?variant=41002951737480), print these:

The ViewFinder Disc
Compass
Compass Post
Compass Flourish
Post-Free Dial
Hour Hand
Minute Hand
Outer Ring
Inner Ring
Bowl Ring
Eye piece


For Assembly:

Glue a paperclip, needle or other small metal pin into the back of the Compass Dial.   I found a combination of [super glue and baking soda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImLAmfM_AgA) to be helpful here when fusing plastics with metals.    There is a 3d printed Dial-Post but it is too small and will eventually break in my experience.

Start with the Box Floor. 
The bottom disc spacer goes on first -though this is kind of optional.  It just allows the glyph disc to spin.  For a static-glyph disc, omit the spacer.
Add the Glyph Disc
Add the Small Disc Spacer
Add the Viewfinder disc 
 - it will snug against the center raise of the floor and be on-top of the small disc spacer.
 - it barely engages with the disc spacer and is fiddly outside of the box but the box will keep it in place later
 
Add the spiral, recommend rotating it to optimize visibility of the viewfinder cutout

You can now press the assembled box floor into the box. 
From here:

Add the inner inset ring to the inner box shelf
Add the small gold ring to the inset ring with a small drop of CA/ Glue
Add Compass Post (hole should face up)
Lightly sand or file the inside of the large and small post spacers
Add the Large Post Spacer
Add the Hour Hand
Add the Small Post Spacer
Add the Minute Hand
Add the Compass
Add the Compass Face
Add the Compass Flourish
Add the Compass Dial
Add the Outer Inset 
Glue or CA the Viewfinder to the Outer Bowl Ring
The Outer Bowl ring should push snugly into the outer inset channel

**General Print Settings and Tips**

Most small parts I printed as solid (100% infill)

Most silk filaments tend to have a directionality where prints going in one direction have the metallic-shine and loose the shine in perpendicular patterns.  I never was able to find a fully satisfying antique-gold filament that went down cleanly and ultimately ended up painting my gold parts with [Krylon Gold Leaf](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Krylon-High-gloss-Metallic-Gold-Leaf-Metallic-Spray-Paint-Actual-Net-Contents-11-oz/1000875130) rattle-can.

If you'd like some natural spirals to show through on a particular disc-shaped part you can use Archimedean-Chord infill pattern and top-layer pattern in the slicer and reduce the number of top layers depending on how much spiral you'd like to bleed through.  

This is .. thematically satisfying but also utilitarian in small parts like the the compass post.  If you print the floor and post in Archimedean-chords, they sort of screw together on assembly. 

The close-up trailer and promo screenshots show the prop is well distressed.   I tossed the box portion around in the driveway and dented it in a few places with a small chain, then sanded out the burs before painting it.  Proper distressing and color is another weakness in my art-fu but I'm excited to see what folks come up in their own makes!
