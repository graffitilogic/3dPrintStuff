"As you know our Exhibition is not only a simple Indiana Jones Prop one, but also one that tell the true story behind each artifacts. In the last 24 hours appear detailed pictures of the Dial of Destiny or "Antikythera" IF we want give this prop this name. With help of Archaeology Experts and Scientist from Italy and Greece we was able to decipher the different signs and symbols on it
On the small inner gold cirle is the greek alphabet
On the in green marked circle are names of greek gods and planets: ΑΦΡΟΔΙΤΗ Venus (Aphrodite) ΗΛΙΟΣ Sun (Helios) ΑΡΗΣ Mars (Ares) ΔΗΑΣ (ΔΙΑΣ is the correct) Zeus ΚΡΟΝΟΣ Saturn (Cronos).
On the in viola marked circle the horoscop signs ΚΡΙΟΣ - Aries ΤΑΧΡΟΣ (correct is ΤΑΥΡΟΣ) - Taurus ΔΙΔΥΜΟΙ - Gemini ΚΑΡΚΙΝΟΣ - Cancer ΛΕΩΝ - Lion ΠΑΡΘΕΝΟΣ - Virgo ΧΗΑΑ - no meaning at all… next sigh should be ΖΥΓΟΣ - Libra ΣΚΟΡΠΙΟΣ - Scorpion ΤΟΞΟΤΗΣ - Sagittarius ΑΙΓΟΚΣΡ (another errors, should be ΑΙΓΩΚΕΡΟΣ) - Capricorn ΤΔΡΟΧΟΟΞ (they just can’t copy, hahaha, should be ΥΔΡΟΧΟΟΣ - Aquarius ΙΧΘΥΕΣ - Pisces
On the in red marked circle greek letter but together like words without sense
On the big gold outer edge just letters and I; II; III copied from latin
We still analyze with our experts the Artifacts and as soon as find more out we will let you know"


As promise here more interesting information about the „Dial of Destiny“ prop
Our Archaeology Experts and Scientist decipher also the at the time visible signs and symbols on the backside
This are the names of the months, as per the calendar of Epirus (North-West part of Greece today). Ancients Greece was consisted from Cities-States and wasn’t like today. Epirus was one of them…
ΦΟΙΝΙΚΑΙΟΣ = FENEKEOS, 
ΚΡΑΝΕΙΟΣ = KRANEOS, 
ΛΑΝΟΤΡΟΠΙΟΣ = LANOTROPEOS, 
ΜΑΧΑΝΕΥΣ = MACHANEFS, 
ΔΩΔΕΚΑΤΕΥΣ = DODEKATEFS, 
ΕΥΚΛΕΙΟΣ = EFKLEOS, 
ΑΡΤΕΜΙΣΙΟΣ = ARTEMESEOS, 
ΨΥΔΡΕΥΣ = PSIDREFS, 
ΓΑΜΕΛΙΟΣ = GAMELEOS, 
ΑΓΡΙΑΝΙΟΣ = AGRIANEOS, 
ΠΑΝΑΜΟΣ = PANAMOS,
ΑΠΕΛΛΑΙΟΣ = APELEYOS
What is very interesting that exactely the same names and symbols can be found in the famous Antikythera
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism
Is the „Dial of Destiny“ Prop maybe a remake of it? We‘ll find out for sure after we see the movie


Thanks to an good friend in Greek we was able to identify the meaning of the rest ancient greek words on the backside. They are the names of the 12 months that are curved in the Antikythera mechanism. 
ΦOINIKΑΙΟΣ, ΚΡΑΝΕΙΟΣ, ΛΑΝΟΤΡΌΠΙΟΣ, ΜΑΧΑΝΕΥΣ, ΔΩΔΕΚΑΤΕΥΣ, ΕΥΚΛΕΙΟΣ, ἈΡΤΕΜΙΣΙΟΣ, ΨΥΔΡΕΥΣ, ΓΑΜΕΙΛΙΟΣ, ἈΓΡΙΑΝΙΟΣ, ΠΑΝΑΜΟΣ, ἈΠΕΛΛΑΙΟΣ
Is the Dial of Destiny a moder version of the Antikythera? All indicative goes is this direction. We will discover the truht once viewed the film
